title: Lessons learned from watching and playing Starcraft II
excerpt: You might think that Starcraft II (SC2) is just a game, but you could very well be mistaken. In my discovery of the SC2 e-sport community, I even found that good SC2 players seem to use tactics that can be applied to running a business.

When I first started playing Starcraft II, I mostly did so because of my fond memories of the original Starcraft and the sheer beauty of the game. After playing through the single player story (which comes highly recommended), I went on to my favorite part of the game in the original game: Multiplayer. So thinking I got the techniques down from the single player, I entered the ladder. And was humiliated. Again and again. I sucked.

h3. More than meets the eye

For a short while I just thought of the other player as lucky, but quickly realized that to actually play this game, I should figure out how this game actually works. It is a real time _strategy_ game, after all. And man, was I "in":http://www.teamliquid.net "for":http://day9tv.blip.tv/ "a":http://www.gomtv.net/ "treat":http://www.gosugamers.net/starcraft2. I might be a laggard, but I was unaware of the state of e-sports and the community thereof. Ever figured that a 'foreign player' would mean 'a player not from South Korea'? Color me intrigued. I started reading about how these professionals became so skilled, and found some sound advice.

h3. Work hard

Or, in "the words of Chill":http://www.teamliquid.net/forum/viewmessage.php?topic_id=66048: _"The first step to improving is committing yourself to improving"_. It's the only way to get better at what you do. Put in hours of work, evaluate often, test out new strategies and learn from mistakes. This is exactly why I love about the _lean_ software methodology; make many small changes, make them fast, and learn from the results.

h3. Know your game

You cannot solve a problem when you have no idea what the problem is. Dealing with certain units compositions requires you to know your the strengths and weaknesses of all the units in the game. Similarly, when trying to serve a niche, or solving any business problem, you should always get to know the real cause of any issue and how to battle it accordingly.

h3. Have a plan, but be flexible

Most strategies in SC2 are described in 'builds' and are mostly step-by-step guides to a certain unit composition, each with different strengths and weaknesses. However, in SC2, as in business, flexibility is key. Even if you execute your build perfectly, you can still be slaughtered if you haven't checked what your opponent is doing. Which brings us to:

h3. Getting information early

Without scouting your opponent, you are absolutely lost. You need to know what you *should* be building by knowing the conditions of the match. Similarly, a startup should get to know their problem space as soon as possible. You cannot build a solution for a problem you do not understand.

h3. Learn from your mistakes

It's ok to make mistakes. That's what makes us human. When you make a mistake, look at what you can do better next time. Just as some view 'creating a twitter clone' the same as 'creating twitter', I was stuck thinking that 'doing roughly the same as this pro player'
