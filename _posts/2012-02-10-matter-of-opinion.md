title: A matter of opinion

> _"Opinions are the cheapest commodity in the world. Everyone has thousands of them."_

Everybody has them, shares them, believes in them. They are concious or subconsious, outspoken or hidden from plain sight. The "Web 2.0" has been build around them. There has never been a time in history where opinions have been more accessible and more respected.

### This is great, but at what cost?

I've been reading about "Generation Z", the generation since 1990 that grew up with digital media, Facebook, Google, etc. They are used to getting all the information on the world with the swipe of a finger, and can follow what their friends are doing with uncanny precision. At the same time, diagnosis of AD(H)D are going [through the roof][adhd], alerting parents that most children are simply unable to focus on class. My opinion (oh, sweet irony) is that the extreme amount of information and opinions are the root of all this. It is very hard to listen to your own voice, produce your own opinions, be creative, when everywhere around you are opinions of others. It's easy to lose yourself in the opinions of others, consuming them, rather than forming them yourself. They already did the work and know what they are talking about, it's just easier to believe in *their* opinion.

### And who can blaim them?

This is new problem. Never in human history has there been a "information overload". Everybody who has used social media intensively know this urge to constantly check what's going on. It's easy consumerism and on days I find myself doing nothing more than consuming information.

## Listening to yourself

What I think is the biggest danger, is losing yourself in the chatter. It takes effort to listen to yourself; I have to be in some quiet spot, for a time, without danger of being distracted. No phone, no e-mail, no computing devices of any sort; just me. I focus on my breathing, like mediation, and see whatever enters my brain. I leave calm, motivated, purposeful. I have no expectations to uphold but my own.
