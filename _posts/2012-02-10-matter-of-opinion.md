> _"Opinions are the cheapest commodity in the world. Everyone has thousands of them."_

Everybody has them, shares them, believes them. They are concious or subconsious, outspoken or hidden. The internet has been build around them. There has never been a time in history where opinions have been more accessible and generally accepted.

This is great, but at what cost?
