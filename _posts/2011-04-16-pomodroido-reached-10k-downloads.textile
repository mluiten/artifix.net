title: Pomodroido download count reached 10K!
---

My first Android application, Pomodroido, has reached the magical border of <b>10K</b> downloads!

And there was much rejoicing! Unfortunatly, I haven't had alot of time to work on the app the last few weeks, but I have some exciting features in the pipeline, which are expected to be released in a few weeks/a month. Some teasers:

* Integration with "Astrid Tasks":http://weloveastrid.com/
* Synchronication with pomodroido.com for public profiles, offering more possibilities for features such as Analytics, Achievements and Leaderbords
